## What is it?
The **iodd ST400** is a USB external SSD/HDD enclosure that also act like a **Virtual, bootable drive emulator**  


## How to:
You store disk image files (for example **ISO** and **VHD**) on the internal drive, then use the ST400’s built in screen/buttons to “mount” one of those images so the computer sees it as a real device (such as a **virtual optical drive**)

### Information
**Virtual ODD (ISO)**: Present an ISO as a bootable virtual optical disc drive.  
**Virtual Drive (VHD)**: Present VHD files as virtual drives (multiple VHD drives can be supported).  
**Ideal use cases**: portable OS installers, recovery/diagnostic toolkits, and IT field work without constantly re-imaging USB sticks.
